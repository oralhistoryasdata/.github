### About Oral History as Data

Oral History as Data was first built in 2018, coming out of work at the University of Idaho Library's [Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning (CD?L)](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/). 
The framework served as the foundation for several digital humanities projects, including [Voices of Gay Rodeo](https://www.voicesofgayrodeo.com/), [Idaho Queered](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/queered/), and [CTRL+Shift](https://ctrl-shift.org/). 

The project is closely related to the [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/) project, and the current iteration was built on top of a CollectionBuilder-GH template.
